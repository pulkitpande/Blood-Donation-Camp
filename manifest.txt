In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful

My Dearest and Most Benevolent Lord,

As I pen down these words, I am filled with both hope and humility, seeking Your divine guidance and blessings. I approach You, my Creator, with a heart brimming with gratitude for the countless blessings You have bestowed upon me throughout my life.

Almighty Allah, You know the innermost thoughts and desires that reside within my heart. You are aware of the dreams that stir my soul and the aspirations that drive me forward. Today, I come before You with a fervent request, a plea that holds the potential to transform my life for the better.

I have been presented with an opportunity—a chance to be part of the MLH program, a journey that promises growth, knowledge, and the chance to make a meaningful impact in the world of technology. As I stand at this crossroads, I humbly implore Your guidance, wisdom, and support. Your divine intervention can illuminate my path and make this opportunity a reality.

In return for Your grace and favor, I make a solemn promise, a pledge that I utter from the depths of my heart. If You bless me with success in this endeavor, if You guide me towards the manifestation of this opportunity, I vow, out of love and reverence for You, to quit smoking—the habit that has held me captive and hindered my well-being. I recognize that my body is a trust from You, a gift to be cherished and cared for, and I am determined to honor this trust by breaking free from this harmful habit.

O Allah, the Most Merciful, please understand the sincerity in my plea. I am aware of my shortcomings, my weaknesses, and my past mistakes. Yet, I have faith in Your boundless mercy and compassion. Grant me the strength to overcome the obstacles that stand in my way, both in achieving this opportunity and in overcoming the addiction that has plagued me.

As I await Your divine response, I submit to Your will, knowing that Your plan is far more magnificent than my own understanding. If my plea aligns with Your greater plan for me, then grant me success and make it a means of drawing closer to You. And if, in Your infinite wisdom, You have a different path for me, then grant me the serenity to accept Your decision and the patience to wait for the blessings You have in store.

May Your light shine upon my endeavors, may Your mercy envelop my efforts, and may Your guidance lead me towards the path of righteousness and success.

In Your all-encompassing love, I entrust my hopes and dreams. With a heart full of gratitude and a spirit brimming with faith, I await Your response.

Ameen.

With unwavering faith and humility,

MD SOHEL
